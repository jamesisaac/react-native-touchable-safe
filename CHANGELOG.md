## 1.1.0

* Add an `all` prop for more concisely/explicitly setting both platforms to the same effect.
* Improve Flow types.

## 1.0.2

* Just resorted to `mixed` for `outerStyle` Flow type, as the last attempt was still insufficient to cover everything which RN allows.

## 1.0.1

* Expanded Flow allowed types for `outerStyle`

## 1.0.0

First public release, with formalized API.
